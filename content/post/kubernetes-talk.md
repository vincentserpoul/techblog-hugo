On the 28th, I was invited to talk at Google Singapore for the Kubernetes birthday http://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/GCPUGSG/events/232659329/?eventId=232659329

I spoke about my experience with Kubernetes in production for one of my side projects.

As I like to experiment stuff, I decide to drop power point and use React Spectacle library for my presentation!

here is the result: https://kuberneprez.surge.sh

here is the source code: https://github.com/vincentserpoul/prez-kubernetes

The framework can be found here: http://stack.formidable.com/spectacle/#/?_k=cyx05u

I will do it again! It was quite a good experience and I always disliked power point anyway.
